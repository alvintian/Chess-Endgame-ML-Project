# Chess-Endgame-ML-Project
This project applies machine learning to predict outcomes in chess endgames involving King and Rook versus King and Pawn. Using a dataset of 3,196 instances, five models were evaluated (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest), with Random Forest achieving the best performance: 98% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.98. Feature importance analysis revealed key positional factors, such as pawn promotion proximity and control of critical squares. These results highlight Random Forest's effectiveness in predicting chess outcomes.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: [Chess (King-Rook vs. King-Pawn)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/22/chess+king+rook+vs+king+pawn)
- **Goal**: Analyze the dataset and compare multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing one.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest (Accuracy: 98%, F1-Score: 0.98)

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training and Evaluation (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN)
- Feature Importance Analysis

## Results
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score.
- Top features: Positional and pawn-related indicators.
